# Local development instructions

Firstly, make sure that you have followed the instructions in the [`contracts` README](../contracts/README.md) to properly set up the files required for the CLI to run.

1. Set up and source your environment variables by copying the example `.env`file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   source .env
   ```

2. Start the CLI:
   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```
